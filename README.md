# Remaining Parts
Receiving Webhooks for End of Day Reports
Implementation:
Create a new route in your Express app to handle end-of-day report webhooks.
Parse the CSV data from the webhook payload and process each row.
Use the processed data to reconcile transactions.
Creating Transaction Records and Reconciliation
Implementation:
Modify your existing webhook handlers to store transaction data in a database.
Include logic to reconcile transactions by comparing webhook data with end-of-day report data.
Store the history of transaction mutations in the database.
Creating Reports Records
Implementation:
Create a new database model for reports.
Whenever a new end-of-day report webhook is received, store the relevant information in the reports database.
AWS Architecture
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can expose your API for requests, manage code execution, and deploy code.
Additionally, consider using AWS RDS for a relational database or Amazon DocumentDB for MongoDB-compatible databases.
Managing Environment Variables
Set environment variables in the Elastic Beanstalk console for sensitive information.
AWS Secrets Manager can be used for managing secrets like API keys.
Scaling and Monitoring
Elastic Beanstalk allows easy scaling.
Consider using Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and setting up alarms to ensure your application is performing well.
Considerations
Design Patterns and SRP
Ensure you follow design patterns like MVC and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in your code structure.
Error Handling
Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
Testing Strategy
Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability of your application.
Testing and Deployment
Set up automated testing before deployment.
Use a CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment.
Prod Monitoring
Implement production monitoring using tools like CloudWatch.
Consider adding logging for better debugging.
